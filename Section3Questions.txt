Section 3
i. The coefficient estimates of the treatment-trial interaction variable is not significant without the weights and is signficant with weights.
ii. Without weights, logged energy consumption for people in the treatment group and in the trial period decreased by 0.008 kwh. Since the results are not statistically signficant, we cannot conclude that the C4 treatment was effective.
iii. With weights, logged energy consumption for people in the treatment group and in the trial period decreased by 0.025 kwh. Assuming that the weights are correct, the regression results were biased downwards in the initital results and when the weights were applied, the treatment effect increased fourfold. The results with weights are statistically signifcant; however, even after the weighting the effects of several of the dummy variables were as large or larger than the treatment effect. Therefore, we would conclude that the C4 treatment was not very effective. The results may be statistically significant, but they are not practically signficant.  
iv. The weights we created balance the dataset on observable characteristics but cannot balance on unobserved characteristics. The observable data omitted many variables and other variables that were collinear. This suggests that the weights may not be reliable and that the coefficent estimates  are therefore not believable.  Additionally, one of the challenges with PSM is that we are balancing treatment and control based on observed characteristics and therefore there could still be endgoneity in the model that we are not controlling for. In future models, we could use an instrumental variable to account for this.
